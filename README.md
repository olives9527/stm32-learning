STM32F103 learning notes from scratch (freshman）
# My STM32 Journey 🚀

## Day 1 — Entering the World of STM32

Today is my **first day learning STM32**.

I am a freshman, and before this I:
- Had learned C language
- Had **never learned microcontrollers**
- Did not understand concepts like GPIO, registers, or binary

At the beginning, I felt confused.

## My First Clear Understanding ✨

Today, I clearly understood **one very important thing**:

> The LED on my STM32F103 board is connected to **PC13**.

This means:
- PC13 is a **real physical pin**
- When I control PC13 in code, the LED changes in the real world

This was the first time I truly felt:
> **Code can control reality.**

---

## What I Learned Today

- STM32 is a small computer used to control hardware
- GPIO is how the chip interacts with the outside world
- PC13 is not just a name — it is a real pin connected to an LED

I did not write much code today,  
but I **built a clear mental model**, which feels very meaningful.

## My Plan

- Learn STM32 step by step
- Focus on understanding, not memorizing
- Record my learning process honestly

This is just the beginning.
